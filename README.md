# Object Detection from Scratch Using Tensorflow and Keras

## What is ```Object Detection```?

Object detection is a computer vision technique for locating instances of objects in images or videos. Object detection algorithms typically leverage machine learning or deep learning to produce meaningful results.

## What is ```Localization Loss```?

The localization loss is a smooth L1 loss between the predicted bounding box correction and the true values. The coordinate correction transformation is same as what R-CNN does in bounding box regression.

## What is ```Tensorflow```?

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

## What is ```Labelme```?

The goal of LabelMe is to provide an online annotation tool to build image databases for computer vision research. You can contribute to the database by visiting the annotation tool. Label objects in the images. Edit your annotations.
